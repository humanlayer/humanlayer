# Linear - Ticket Management

You are tasked with managing Linear tickets, including creating tickets from thoughts documents, updating existing tickets, and following the team's specific workflow patterns.

## Initial Setup

First, verify that Linear MCP tools are available by checking if any `mcp__linear__` tools exist. If not, respond:
```
I need access to Linear tools to help with ticket management. Please run the `/mcp` command to enable the Linear MCP server, then try again.
```

If tools are available, respond based on the user's request:

### For general requests:
```
I can help you with Linear tickets. What would you like to do?
1. Create a new ticket from a thoughts document
2. Add a link or comment to an existing ticket
3. Search for tickets
4. Update ticket status or details
```

### For specific create requests:
```
I'll help you create a Linear ticket from your thoughts document. Please provide:
1. The path to the thoughts document (or topic to search for)
2. Any specific focus or angle for the ticket (optional)
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Team Workflow & Status Progression

The team follows a specific workflow to ensure alignment before code implementation:

1. **Triage** → All new tickets start here for initial review
2. **Spec Needed** → Ticket needs an implementation plan/spec
3. **Spec in Review** → Spec is written and under discussion
4. **Ready for Dev** → Spec approved, ready for implementation
5. **In Dev** → Active development
6. **Code Review** → PR submitted
7. **Done** → Completed

**Key principle**: Review and alignment happen at the spec stage (not PR stage) to move faster and avoid rework.

## Important Conventions

### URL Mapping for Thoughts Documents
When referencing thoughts documents, always provide GitHub links using the `links` parameter:
- `thoughts/shared/...` → `https://github.com/humanlayer/thoughts/blob/main/repos/humanlayer/shared/...`
- `thoughts/allison/...` → `https://github.com/humanlayer/thoughts/blob/main/repos/humanlayer/allison/...`
- `thoughts/global/...` → `https://github.com/humanlayer/thoughts/blob/main/global/...`

### Default Values
- **Status**: Always create new tickets in "Triage" status
- **Priority**: Default to Medium (3) for most tasks, use best judgment or ask user
  - Urgent (1): Critical blockers, security issues
  - High (2): Important features with deadlines, major bugs
  - Medium (3): Standard implementation tasks (default)
  - Low (4): Nice-to-haves, minor improvements
- **Links**: Use the `links` parameter to attach URLs (not just markdown links in description)

## Action-Specific Instructions

### 1. Creating Tickets from Thoughts

#### Steps to follow after receiving the request:

1. **Locate and read the thoughts document:**
   - If given a path, read the document directly
   - If given a topic/keyword, search thoughts/ directory using Grep to find relevant documents
   - If multiple matches found, show list and ask user to select
   - Create a TodoWrite list to track: Read document → Analyze content → Draft ticket → Get user input → Create ticket

2. **Analyze the document content:**
   - Identify the core problem or feature being discussed
   - Extract key implementation details or technical decisions
   - Note any specific code files or areas mentioned
   - Look for action items or next steps
   - Identify what stage the idea is at (early ideation vs ready to implement)

3. **Check for related context (if mentioned in doc):**
   - If the document references specific code files, read relevant sections
   - If it mentions other thoughts documents, quickly check them
   - Look for any existing Linear tickets mentioned

4. **Get Linear workspace context:**
   - List teams: `mcp__linear__list_teams`
   - If multiple teams, ask user to select one
   - List projects for selected team: `mcp__linear__list_projects`

5. **Draft the ticket summary:**
   Present a draft to the user:
   ```
   ## Draft Linear Ticket

   **Title**: [Clear, action-oriented title]

   **Description**:
   [2-3 sentence summary of the problem/goal]

   ## Key Details
   - [Bullet points of important details from thoughts]
   - [Technical decisions or constraints]
   - [Any specific requirements]

   ## Implementation Notes (if applicable)
   [Any specific technical approach or steps outlined]

   ## References
   - Source: `thoughts/[path/to/document.md]` ([View on GitHub](converted GitHub URL))
   - Related code: [any file:line references]
   - Parent ticket: [if applicable]

   ---
   Based on the document, this seems to be at the stage of: [ideation/planning/ready to implement]
   ```

6. **Interactive refinement:**
   Ask the user:
   - Does this summary capture the ticket accurately?
   - Which project should this go in? [show list]
   - What priority? (Default: Medium/3)
   - Any additional context to add?
   - Should we include more/less implementation detail?
   - Do you want to assign it to yourself?
   
   Note: Ticket will be created in "Triage" status by default.

7. **Create the Linear ticket:**
   ```
   mcp__linear__create_issue with:
   - title: [refined title]
   - description: [final description in markdown]
   - teamId: [selected team]
   - projectId: [if selected]
   - priority: [selected priority number, default 3]
   - stateId: [Triage status ID]
   - assigneeId: [if requested]
   - links: [{url: "GitHub URL", title: "Document Title"}]
   ```

8. **Post-creation actions:**
   - Show the created ticket URL
   - Ask if user wants to:
     - Add a comment with additional implementation details
     - Create sub-tasks for specific action items
     - Update the original thoughts document with the ticket reference
   - If yes to updating thoughts doc:
     ```
     Add at the top of the document:
     ---
     linear_ticket: [URL]
     created: [date]
     ---
     ```

## Example transformations:

### From verbose thoughts:
```
"I've been thinking about how our resumed sessions don't inherit permissions properly.
This is causing issues where users have to re-specify everything. We should probably
store all the config in the database and then pull it when resuming. Maybe we need
new columns for permission_prompt_tool and allowed_tools..."
```

### To concise ticket:
```
Title: Fix resumed sessions to inherit all configuration from parent

Description:
Currently, resumed sessions only inherit Model and WorkingDir from parent sessions,
causing all other configuration to be lost. Users must re-specify permissions and
settings when resuming.

## Solution
Store all session configuration in the database and automatically inherit it when
resuming sessions, with support for explicit overrides.
```

### 2. Adding Links or Comments to Existing Tickets

When user wants to add information to an existing ticket:

1. **Get ticket identifier:**
   - Ask for ticket ID (e.g., ENG-1234) or URL
   - Use `mcp__linear__get_issue` to fetch current ticket details

2. **Determine action:**
   - Add a link: Use `mcp__linear__update_issue` with links parameter
   - Add a comment: Use `mcp__linear__create_comment`
   - Update status: Use `mcp__linear__update_issue` with stateId

3. **For adding links:**
   ```
   mcp__linear__update_issue with:
   - id: [ticket ID]
   - links: [existing links + new link with proper title]
   ```

4. **For adding comments:**
   ```
   mcp__linear__create_comment with:
   - issueId: [ticket ID]
   - body: [markdown formatted comment]
   ```

### 3. Searching for Tickets

When user wants to find tickets:

1. **Gather search criteria:**
   - Query text
   - Team/Project filters
   - Status filters
   - Date ranges (createdAt, updatedAt)

2. **Execute search:**
   ```
   mcp__linear__list_issues with:
   - query: [search text]
   - teamId: [if specified]
   - projectId: [if specified]
   - stateId: [if filtering by status]
   - limit: 20
   ```

3. **Present results:**
   - Show ticket ID, title, status, assignee
   - Group by project if multiple projects
   - Include direct links to Linear

### 4. Updating Ticket Status

When moving tickets through the workflow:

1. **Get current status:**
   - Fetch ticket details
   - Show current status in workflow

2. **Suggest next status:**
   - Triage → Spec Needed (needs implementation plan)
   - Spec Needed → Spec in Review (plan written)
   - Spec in Review → Ready for Dev (plan approved)
   - Ready for Dev → In Dev (work started)

3. **Update with context:**
   ```
   mcp__linear__update_issue with:
   - id: [ticket ID]
   - stateId: [new status ID]
   ```
   
   Consider adding a comment explaining the status change.

## Important Notes

- Keep tickets concise but complete - aim for scannable content
- Focus on the "what" and "why", include "how" only if well-defined
- Always preserve links to source material using the `links` parameter
- Don't create tickets from early-stage brainstorming unless requested
- Use proper Linear markdown formatting
- Include code references as: `path/to/file.ext:linenum`
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing project/status
- Remember that Linear descriptions support full markdown including code blocks
- Always use the `links` parameter for external URLs (not just markdown links)
