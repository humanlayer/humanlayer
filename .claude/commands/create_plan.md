# Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:
   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message
   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:
```
I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.

Please provide:
1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a ticket file)
2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements
3. Links to related research or previous implementations

I'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.

Tip: You can also invoke this command with a ticket file directly: `/implementation_plan thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`
For deeper analysis, try: `/implementation_plan think deeply about thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:
   - Ticket files (e.g., `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1234.md`)
   - Research documents
   - Related implementation plans
   - Any JSON/data files mentioned
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: DO NOT spawn sub-tasks before reading these files yourself in the main context
   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:
   Before asking the user any questions, spawn these parallel research tasks:

   ```
   Task 1 - Find relevant files:
   Research what files and directories are relevant to [the ticket/task].
   1. Based on the ticket description, identify the main components involved
   2. Find all relevant source files, configs, and tests
   3. Look for similar features or patterns in the codebase
   4. Identify the specific directories to focus on (e.g., if WUI is mentioned, focus on humanlayer-wui/)
   5. Return a comprehensive list of files that need to be examined
   Use tools: Grep, Glob, LS
   Return: List of specific file paths to read and which directories contain the relevant code
   ```

   ```
   Task 2 - Understand current implementation:
   Research how [the feature/component] currently works.
   1. Find the main implementation files in [specific directory if known]
   2. Trace the data flow and key functions
   3. Identify APIs, state management, and communication patterns
   4. Look for any existing bugs or TODOs related to this area
   5. Find relevant tests that show expected behavior
   Return: Detailed explanation of current implementation with file:line references
   ```

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:
   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant
   - Read them FULLY into the main context
   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding

4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:
   - Cross-reference the ticket requirements with actual code
   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings
   - Note assumptions that need verification
   - Determine true scope based on codebase reality

5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:
   ```
   Based on the ticket and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that:
   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]
   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]

   Questions that my research couldn't answer:
   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]
   - [Business logic clarification]
   - [Design preference that affects implementation]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:
   - DO NOT just accept the correction
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information
   - Read the specific files/directories they mention
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks

3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - Each sub-task should focus on a specific area or component
   - Write detailed prompts for each sub-agent following these guidelines:

   **Example sub-task prompts**:
   ```
   Task 1 - Research existing [component] implementation:
   1. Find all files related to [component] in [directory]
   2. Identify the current implementation pattern (include file:line references)
   3. Look for similar features that we can model after
   4. Find any utility functions or helpers we should reuse
   5. Note any conventions or patterns that must be followed
   Use read-only tools: Read, Grep, Glob, LS
   Return: Specific file paths, line numbers, and code patterns found
   ```

   ```
   Task 2 - Investigate [related system]:
   1. Search for how [system] currently works
   2. Find the data model and schema definitions
   3. Identify API endpoints or RPC methods
   4. Look for existing tests that show usage patterns
   5. Note any performance considerations or limitations
   Return: Technical details with file:line references
   ```

   ```
   Task 3 - Research dependencies and integration points:
   1. Find where [feature] would need to integrate
   2. Check for any existing interfaces we need to implement
   3. Look for configuration or feature flags
   4. Identify potential breaking changes
   5. Find related documentation or comments
   Return: Integration requirements and constraints
   ```

3. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

4. **Present findings and design options**:
   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:

   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about existing code]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]

   **Design Options:**
   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]

   **Open Questions:**
   - [Technical uncertainty]
   - [Design decision needed]

   Which approach aligns best with your vision?
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:
   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?
   ```

2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Write the plan** to `thoughts/shared/plans/{descriptive_name}.md`
2. **Use this template structure**:

```markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## References

- Original ticket: `thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_XXXX.md`
- Related research: `thoughts/shared/research/[relevant].md`
- Similar implementation: `[file:line]`
```

### Step 5: Review & Refinement

1. **Present the draft plan location**:
   ```
   I've created the initial implementation plan at:
   `thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md`

   Please review it and let me know:
   - Are the phases properly scoped?
   - Are the success criteria specific enough?
   - Any technical details that need adjustment?
   - Missing edge cases or considerations?
   ```

2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:
   - Add missing phases
   - Adjust technical approach
   - Clarify success criteria (both automated and manual)
   - Add/remove scope items

3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:
   - Question vague requirements
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Ask "why" and "what about"
   - Don't assume - verify with code

2. **Be Interactive**:
   - Don't write the full plan in one shot
   - Get buy-in at each major step
   - Allow course corrections
   - Work collaboratively

3. **Be Thorough**:
   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Write measurable success criteria with clear automated vs manual distinction

4. **Be Practical**:
   - Focus on incremental, testable changes
   - Consider migration and rollback
   - Think about edge cases
   - Include "what we're NOT doing"

5. **Track Progress**:
   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
   - Update todos as you complete research
   - Mark planning tasks complete when done

6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:
   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP
   - Research or ask for clarification immediately
   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions
   - The implementation plan must be complete and actionable
   - Every decision must be made before finalizing the plan

## Success Criteria Guidelines

**Always separate success criteria into two categories:**

1. **Automated Verification** (can be run by execution agents):
   - Commands that can be run: `make test`, `npm run lint`, etc.
   - Specific files that should exist
   - Code compilation/type checking
   - Automated test suites

2. **Manual Verification** (requires human testing):
   - UI/UX functionality
   - Performance under real conditions
   - Edge cases that are hard to automate
   - User acceptance criteria

**Format example:**
```markdown
### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Database migration runs successfully: `make migrate`
- [ ] All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`
- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run`
- [ ] API endpoint returns 200: `curl localhost:8080/api/new-endpoint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] New feature appears correctly in the UI
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with 1000+ items
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Feature works correctly on mobile devices
```

## Common Patterns

### For Database Changes:
- Start with schema/migration
- Add store methods
- Update business logic
- Expose via API
- Update clients

### For New Features:
- Research existing patterns first
- Start with data model
- Build backend logic
- Add API endpoints
- Implement UI last

### For Refactoring:
- Document current behavior
- Plan incremental changes
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Include migration strategy

## Sub-task Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide detailed instructions** including:
   - Exactly what to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
   - Expected output format
4. **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories**:
   - If the ticket mentions "WUI", specify `humanlayer-wui/` directory
   - If it mentions "daemon", specify `hld/` directory
   - Never use generic terms like "UI" when you mean "WUI"
   - Include the full path context in your prompts
5. **Specify read-only tools** to use
6. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
7. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing
8. **Verify sub-task results**:
   - If a sub-task returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up tasks
   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase
   - Don't accept results that seem incorrect

Example of spawning multiple tasks:
```python
# Spawn these tasks concurrently:
tasks = [
    Task("Research database schema", db_research_prompt),
    Task("Find API patterns", api_research_prompt),
    Task("Investigate UI components", ui_research_prompt),
    Task("Check test patterns", test_research_prompt)
]
```

## Example Interaction Flow

```
User: /implementation_plan
Assistant: I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan...

User: We need to add parent-child tracking for Claude sub-tasks. See thoughts/allison/tickets/eng_1478.md
Assistant: Let me read that ticket file completely first...

[Reads file fully]

Based on the ticket, I understand we need to track parent-child relationships for Claude sub-task events in the hld daemon. Before I start planning, I have some questions...
